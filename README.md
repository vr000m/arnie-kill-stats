Earlier today, the Internet was abuzz with a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE6jpTaOYMU) of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kill count. Each kill is categorized in ```killstats.txt``` broadly by movie, year, method or weapon used and the number of fatalities.

```@Total kills:  509```


I'd have thought they'd be more.  The later two ___Terminator___ movies had one kill each (the terminator) and consequently a suicude. ___End of days___ was the only other movie where Arnie dies.
1 aligator was shot and 1 vulture's neck was bitten by Conan. Some bizzare killings are using an alligator, electrocution, crowbar, a fighter jet (see the [weapons](https://github.com/vr000m/arnie-kill-stats/blob/master/_weapon.log) list).

Figure 1 shows the kills over the years, 1984-87 appear to be his prolific years and in ___Commando___, he got the most action.

Guns is his weapon of choice but he can easily kill with his bare hands, or a sword/knife, or blow you up.

Figure 4 shows the kills by each weapon in each calendar year.

Over the years, Arnold prefered to use more guns than swords, is it because the roles where he yields a sword have dried up?
