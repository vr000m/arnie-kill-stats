Earlier today, the Internet was abuzz with a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE6jpTaOYMU) of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kill count. Each kill is categorized in ```killstats.txt``` broadly by movie, year, method or weapon used and the number of fatalities.

```@Total kills:  509```


I'd have thought they'd be more.  The later two __Terminator__ movies had one kill each (the terminator) and consequently a suicude. __End of days__ was the only other movie where Arnie dies.
1 aligator was shot and 1 vulture's neck was bitten by Conan. Some bizzare killings are using an alligator, electrocution, crowbar, a fighter jet (see the [weapons](https://github.com/vr000m/arnie-kill-stats/blob/master/_weapon.log) list).

Figure 1 shows the kills over the years, 1984-87 appear to be his prolific years and in __Commando__, he got the most action.

Guns is his weapon of choice but he can easily kill with his bare hands (shown by *strength* in the graph), or a sword/knife, or blow things up, typically resulting multiple kills. His biggest burst was **8** in __Commando__, this has been repeated in several other movies such as, True Lies, Predator, Eraser, Predator.

Lastly, when he seems to have no weapon, he runs people over ;). 3 people were killed by cars.

Figure 4 shows the kills by each weapon in each calendar year. In 1985, Arnold killed with any and all means (e.g., swords, guns, bombs, bare hands, etc.), it is also his most prolific year (by a factor of 2). Over the years, he's reduced using his bare hands to kill people, may be something to do with age and maturity in action roles (e.g.,Expendibles 2).

Over the years, Arnold prefered to use more guns than swords, is it because the roles where he yields a sword have dried up?
